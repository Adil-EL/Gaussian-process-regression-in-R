# Gaussian-process-regression-in-R
Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a nonparametric, Bayesian approach to regression that is making waves in the area of machine learning. 
GPR has several benefits, working well on small datasets and having the ability to provide uncertainty measurements on the predictions.
In this repository, I present a simple R implemenation for this regression method :

steps:
1-coding a kernel (Brownien kernel).
2-Simulate a dataset.
3-coding the mean and the covariance of the GPR.
4-plotting the results.
5-making some predictions.
